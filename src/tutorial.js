	At each step in time, the following transitions occur: <br/>

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. <br/>
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br/>
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br/>
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br/>
